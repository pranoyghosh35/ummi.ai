You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
And now that you're here
My dreams are waking
And I will keep you from all harm

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
But please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you
And make you happy
I'll pick you up when
You've fallen down
You turn the sky blue
When it is raining
You'll always keep the sunshine around

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
