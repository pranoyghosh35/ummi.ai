Hush, little baby, don't say a word.
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

if that mockingbird won't sing,
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

if that diamond ring turns brass,
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass

if that looking glass gets broke,
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

if that billy goat won't pull,
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull

if that cart and bull turn over,
Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover

if that dog named Rover won't bark
Mama's gonna buy you a horse and cart

if that horse and cart fall down,
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.

Hush little baby don't cry cause, 
daddy loves you and so do I.

Hush little baby don't say a word
Hush little baby don't say a word.
