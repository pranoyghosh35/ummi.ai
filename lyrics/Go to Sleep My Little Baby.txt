Go to sleep little baby 
Go to sleep little baby
Your Mama's gonna sway 
And you daddy's gonna pray
Won't you close your eyes little baby
Go to sleep little baby
Go to sleep little baby
Everybody's gone only us until the dawn
Won't you close your eyes little baby
You're a sweet little baby
Won't you close your eyes little one
The chair is gonna rock
But the cryin' don't stop
Gonna sing a little song to the baby
Don't you weep pretty baby
Don't you weep pretty baby
Almost had you down 
Then there was a sudden sound
Now we gotta start over sleepy baby
Go to sleep little baby
Go to sleep little baby
So much to do 
And tomorrow's comin' soon
Won't you rest till then tired baby
Go to sleep little baby
Go to sleep little baby
Come with me but sleep carefully
At last we've got a sleeping baby
