The Camel And The Baby
A baby camel once asked her mother why they had humps, round hooves, and long eyelashes. The mother explained that the humps could store water, the rounded hooves were to help them walk through the desert, and the long eyelashes protected their eyes from sand. The baby thought over this and then asked her mother if they have all these qualities for the desert, why are they in a zoo? The mother was dumbfounded.
