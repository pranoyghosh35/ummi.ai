A Glass of Milk
There was a poor boy who would sell newspapers to pay for school. One day, he was ravenous and decided to ask for food at the next house he visited. Several people denied him food. However, a girl at one house offered him a glass of milk. She refused to take payment for it. After many years, this girl fell sick. No doctor wanted to help her. She decided to go to the best doctor in the town. The doctor spent months treating her, though she could not afford the service. When she received the hospital bill, it read 'Paid in full, with a glass of milk.'

Moral: Good deeds are always rewarded.
