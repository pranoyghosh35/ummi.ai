The Leap at Rhodes
There was a man who used to travel to foreign lands. He would only talk about his adventures and deeds. He claimed he had made a great leap in a city called Rhodes. He bragged about it to no end. One listener told him to prove it physically, and he could not.

Moral: It is the deed that counts.
