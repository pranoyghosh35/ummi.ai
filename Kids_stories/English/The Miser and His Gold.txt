The Miser and His Gold
Once, there was a miser who would hide all his gold under the stones in his garden. He never spent his gold, and without fail, he would count his coins before going to bed every day. One day a thief spotted him counting his coins. After the miser went to sleep, the thief stole all the gold. The next day, the miser saw that all his gold was missing and started wailing. His neighbours came running and asked him what had happened. The neighbours asked him why he didnâ€™t keep the gold in the house since it would be easy to access inside. The mise revealed he never planned on spending the gold. The neighbours told him he might as well save his stones, as the unused gold was just as useless.

Moral: A possession is important only if you use it.
