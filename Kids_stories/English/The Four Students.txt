The Four Students
Four friends who hated studying partied all night before their exams. They asked the Dean to give them a second chance by lying about their whereabouts. They told the Dean they had gone to a wedding the night before, and on their way back, they had a flat tire, requiring them to push the car all the way back. The Dean agreed to let them take the test again. They studied hard for the exam. On the exam day, they were made to sit in separate classrooms and were given only two questions:

Your name
Which tire of the car burst: a) Front Left b) Front right c) Rear left d) Rear right
Moral: You may be smart, but there are smarter people than you.
