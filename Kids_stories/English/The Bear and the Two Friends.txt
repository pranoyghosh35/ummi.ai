The Bear and the Two Friends
Two friends were walking through the forest. Since it was dangerous, they promised to stay close to each other. They see a bear approaching them. One friend scurries up a tree, leaving the other one behind. The other friend decided to pretend to be dead. The bear approached him, smelled his ear and then left. The friend in the tree climbed down and asked the other friend what the bear had told him. He replies, “The bear simply advised against believing a false friend.”

Moral: True friends stick with you through all situations.
