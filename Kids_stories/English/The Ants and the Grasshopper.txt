The Ants and the Grasshopper
A family of ants was drying out the grain they had stored during the summer. A hungry grasshopper comes to them and asks for some food. They asked him why he had not saved any food for the winter. The grasshopper said he was too busy making music during the summer that he didn’t save any food. The ants had no sympathy for the grasshopper and went back to work. Can you guess the ant and grasshopper story moral?

Moral: There’s a time to work and a time to play.
