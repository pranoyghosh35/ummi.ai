The Cows And The Tiger
Four cows lived in a forest. They were good friends who did everything together. No other predators were able to kill them for food. One day, they fought and decided to graze in different directions. A tiger saw this and decided it would be easy to kill them now. The tiger hid in a bush and killed the cows one by one.

Moral: There is strength in numbers.
