The Rabbit and the Partridge
A partridge could not find food near its home, so it travelled far away to some cornfields. It stayed there for a few days before returning home. Meanwhile, a rabbit had found the empty nest and made itself at home. When the partridge returned, they both fought over whose house it was. The other animals suggested going to a judge. They found a praying cat by the river and decided to ask for help. Seeing how the cat was praying, they trusted it. The cat heard them both out but asked them to come closer as he couldn’t hear well. When they got closer, the cat killed and ate them both.

Moral: Don’t trust strangers no matter how friendly they seem.
