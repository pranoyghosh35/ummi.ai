The Wolf and the Sheep
There was a wolf who got injured while fighting a bear. He wasn’t able to get himself food or water. One day a sheep passed by him. He asked the sheep to get him water, so he had the strength to get solid food. The sheep quickly realised he was the solid food, said he would not get the wolf any water, and went away.

Moral: You can spot a person’s ulterior motives if you pay attention.
