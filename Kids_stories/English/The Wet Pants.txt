The Wet Pants
There was once a young boy in school. He had wet his pants and was scared that his class would make fun of him. He noticed that the teacher and a classmate were walking towards him with a goldfish bowl. The young girl trips and drops the fishbowl in his lap. The rest of the classmates think it is her fault for wetting his pants. Later, he asks her if she did that on purpose. She tells him, “I wet my pants once too.”
