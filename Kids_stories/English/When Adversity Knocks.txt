When Adversity Knocks
There once was a girl who was frustrated with life and asked her father for advice. He asked her to bring an egg, two tea leaves, and a potato. He then started boiling water in three separate vessels. He put the egg, potato, and tea leaves in one vessel each. After a few minutes, he asked her to peel the egg and potato and strain the leaves. He explained to his daughter that:

The soft egg was now hard.
The hard potato was now soft.
The tea had changed the water itself.
When adversity is at our door, we can respond to it in different ways.

Moral: We decide how to respond to difficult situations.
