The Young Crab And His Mother
One day, a young crab was trying to move. But, he could only move sideways. The mother admonishes him and tells him to walk forward by pointing his toes out front. The young crab says he doesnâ€™t know how, so the mother gets up to show him. However, she cannot walk forward either. She realises how unfair she was being and apologises to him.

Moral: Do not condemn others for what you cannot do yourself.
