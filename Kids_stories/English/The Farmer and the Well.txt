The Farmer and the Well
A farmer bought a well from his neighbour to water his farm. The neighbour sold him the well but did not allow him to draw water from it. The farmer went to the emperor for justice. His courtier questioned the neighbour, who said that he had sold the well but not the water within it. The neighbour was told to either pay rent for the water to remove it all immediately. Realising that his trick didnâ€™t work, he apologised and went home.
