The Wolf And The Shepherds
One day a wolf was chased away for trying to steal some sheep from a farm. Later that week, the wolf returned to the farm, hoping to find food. He found that the farmer’s family was eating lamb roast. He was dismayed that he was chased off for wanting the same thing the farmer’s family had done.

Moral: We are quick to condemn others without realising our own faults.
