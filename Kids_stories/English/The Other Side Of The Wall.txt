The Other Side Of The Wall
There was a young woman who was fond of gardening. She took great care of her garden. One day she found a plant in a catalogue and decided she wanted to plant it. She planted it at the base of the stonewall in her garden. It quickly grew, but no flowers bloomed on the tree. She thought she would cut it down, but her neighbour called her and thanked her for the beautiful flowers blooming on its vines. She rushes over and realises that the vine had crept through the crevices of the stonewall. The flowers had bloomed generously on the other side.

Moral: You may not see the results, but that doesnâ€™t mean your efforts bore no fruit.
