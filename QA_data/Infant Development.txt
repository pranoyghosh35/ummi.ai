1. Passage: Milestones of Infant Development

Infant development refers to the progressive changes and achievements that occur in a baby's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional abilities during the first year of life. These milestones are typically categorized into domains such as motor skills, language and communication, cognitive development, and social-emotional development. Motor skill milestones include lifting the head, rolling over, sitting up, crawling, and eventually walking. Language development progresses from cooing and babbling to understanding simple words and eventually forming basic sentences. Cognitive milestones include object permanence, symbolic play, and problem-solving abilities, while social-emotional milestones involve attachment, smiling, and responding to caregivers' emotions.

Possible Questions:
Q1.1 What are some examples of motor skill milestones in infants?
Q1.2 How does language development progress during the first year of life?
Q1.3 What are some cognitive milestones that infants typically achieve?
Q1.4 How do infants demonstrate social-emotional development in their first year?

2. Passage: Sensory Development in Infants

Sensory development plays a crucial role in infants' ability to perceive and interact with their environment. During the first few months of life, infants' sensory systems, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, undergo rapid development. Newborns have limited visual acuity and prefer high-contrast patterns and faces, gradually developing color vision and depth perception. Their auditory system is sensitive to sound, and infants can recognize familiar voices and sounds. Touch is an essential means of communication and comfort, while taste and smell contribute to infants' feeding behaviors and bonding with caregivers.

Possible Questions:
Q2.1 How does infants' vision develop during the first few months of life?
Q2.2 What types of sounds and voices do newborns prefer, and how does their auditory perception develop?
Q2.3 How do infants use touch to communicate and seek comfort?
Q2.4 What role do taste and smell play in infants' feeding behaviors and bonding with caregivers?

3. Passage: Cognitive Development in Infants

Cognitive development refers to the growth of thinking, problem-solving, and memory skills in infants. Piaget's theory of cognitive development outlines several stages of cognitive growth, including the sensorimotor stage, which spans the first two years of life. During this stage, infants explore their environment through sensory experiences and motor actions, gradually developing object permanence, the understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight. Infants also engage in symbolic play, imitating actions and using objects to represent other things, which lays the foundation for later cognitive abilities.

Possible Questions:
Q3.1 What is object permanence, and how does it develop in infants?
Q3.2 How do infants demonstrate symbolic play, and what role does it play in cognitive development?
Q3.3 What are some other cognitive abilities that infants develop during the sensorimotor stage?

4. Passage: Social-Emotional Development in Infants

Social-emotional development involves the formation of emotional bonds, the development of self-awareness and empathy, and the ability to regulate emotions and interact with others. Attachment, the strong emotional bond between infants and their primary caregivers, is a critical aspect of social-emotional development. Infants form attachments through consistent caregiving, responsive interactions, and the provision of comfort and security. They also begin to express a range of emotions, including joy, sadness, fear, and frustration, and learn to interpret and respond to others' emotional cues.

Possible Questions:
Q4.1 What is attachment, and how does it develop in infants?
Q4.2 How do infants express and regulate their emotions?
Q4.3 What role do caregivers play in supporting infants' social-emotional development?
