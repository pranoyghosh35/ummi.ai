1. Passage: Balanced Diet Recommendations for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Mothers

Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial for the health and well-being of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, as well as for the optimal development of their babies. A balanced diet during pregnancy should include a variety of nutrient-rich foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Key nutrients to focus on include folate, iron, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein. It's essential to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and to avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol intake.

During breastfeeding, mothers should continue to consume a nutrient-rich diet to support milk production and provide essential nutrients to their babies. Nutrient needs may increase during breastfeeding, particularly for protein, calcium, and certain vitamins and minerals. Including foods such as lean meats, fish, dairy products, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and plenty of fruits and vegetables can help meet these increased nutrient needs.
