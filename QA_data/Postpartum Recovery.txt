1. Passage: Physical Recovery After Childbirth

Postpartum recovery involves the body's healing process following childbirth, typically lasting six weeks or longer. During this time, the uterus gradually contracts back to its pre-pregnancy size (a process known as involution), vaginal bleeding (lochia) occurs as the body sheds excess tissue from the uterus, and the perineum heals from any tears or episiotomy. Additionally, postpartum women may experience changes in hormone levels, breast engorgement as milk production begins, and abdominal muscle separation (diastasis recti).

2. Passage: Emotional Adjustment to Motherhood

Emotionally, the postpartum period can be characterized by a range of feelings, including joy, elation, anxiety, and sadness (often referred to as the "baby blues"). It is normal for new mothers to experience mood swings, fatigue, and feelings of overwhelm as they adjust to the demands of motherhood. However, persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or inability to cope may indicate postpartum depression, a serious mental health condition that requires professional support and treatment.
